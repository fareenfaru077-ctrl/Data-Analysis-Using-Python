# 📊 Sales Data Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Description

This project analyzes a sales dataset using **Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib**.
It performs data inspection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization to extract meaningful business insights such as:

* Product-wise sales
* Region-wise sales
* Monthly trends
* Highest selling product
* Overall sales

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

## 📂 Dataset Required

The script expects a CSV file named:

```
sales_dataset.csv
```

The dataset should contain at least these columns:

```
Product, Quantity, Price, Date
```

If the dataset does not contain **Sales** or **Area** columns, the script automatically generates them.
